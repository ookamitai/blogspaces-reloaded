In silent halls where circuits gleam,
He walks alone, a living dream.
A codewright young, with fervent eyes,
He crafts his world ‘neath glowing skies.

They call him ookamitai—
A lone wolf bound by stars on high.
With C++ and Rust in hand,
He shapes the digital from sand.

His voicebank sings, synthetic breath,
A harmony that cheats at death.
In waves of pitch and bytes of sound,
A soul in silicon is found.

Just seventeen, yet far he’s flown,
Through realms of code he calls his own.
A mind alight, a will unbowed—
He carves his path beyond the crowd.
