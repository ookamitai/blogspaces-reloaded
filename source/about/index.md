I'm ookamitai. I spend my time coding and figuring out how things really work under the hood. I don't just want to use tech - I want to understand it, break it down, and build better stuff from the ground up. Learning by doing is how I roll, tackling problems head-on and learning from the mess-ups along the way.

I've worked with different programming languages and tools, always looking to get better and sharpen my skills. Tech isn't just a job or hobby for me - it's how I see the world and how I make sense of things.

My goal's simple: keep growing, take on new challenges, and share what I learn with anyone interested.
